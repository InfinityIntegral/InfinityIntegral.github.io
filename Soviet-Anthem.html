			<h1>Soviet songs</h1>
			<p>
				This page used to be for the Soviet Anthem only, but I added 2 other songs, all from the Soviet Union. These songs are the nicest ones that I can find, having an excellent melody and a positive message.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to GitHub restrictions on website traffic, I am unable to put the audio files here without compromising the performance of my website. Therefore for each song I will leave a link to YouTube for you to listen to the song. If you want the audio file, use a <a href="https://ytmp3.nu/">YouTube downloader</a>. If you cannot access YouTube due to your country's internet restrictions, message me for the audio files. I also have 30min long study music versions of these songs that you can message me to get.

			<h2>Soviet Anthem</h2>
			<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k3IQC3HCg-w&pp=ygUhc292aWV0IHVuaW9uIGFudGhlbSBpbnN0cnVtZW50YWwg">link to YouTube</a></p>
			<p>
				Unsurprisingly, this is the National Anthem of the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1971. Lyrics are shown below.
			</p>
			<p>
Unbreakable Union of freeborn Republics,<br/>
Great Russia has welded forever to stand.<br/>
Created in struggle by will of the people,<br/>
United and mighty, our Soviet land!<br/><br/>

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,<br/>
Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong.<br/>
O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,<br/>
To Communism's triumph lead us on!<br/><br/>

Through tempests the sunrays of freedom have cheered us,<br/>
Along the new path where great Lenin did lead.<br/>
To a righteous cause he raised up the peoples,<br/>
Inspired them to labour and valourous deed.<br/><br/>

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,<br/>
Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong.<br/>
O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,<br/>
To Communism's triumph lead us on!<br/><br/>

In the victory of Communism's immortal ideal,<br/>
We see the future of our dear land.<br/>
And to her fluttering scarlet banner,<br/>
Selflessly true we always shall stand!<br/><br/>

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,<br/>
Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong.<br/>
O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,<br/>
To Communism's triumph lead us on!
			</p>
			<h2>Glory to the ones who look forwards</h2>

				This is a song written in support of the Soviet Space Program, encouraging all people to contribute to the progress of Science. Lyrics are below.
			</p>
			<p>
The banner of Lenin flies above us,<br/>
We have come to build happiness,<br/>
Young hands write,<br/>
The biography of the Earth.<br/><br/>
 
Glory to those who look forward!<br/>
Glory to those who go forward!<br/>
Our path starts from the present<br/>
To the bright future!<br/>
Our path starts from the present<br/>
To the coming years!<br/><br/>
 
Youth is like a star rocket,<br/>
He strives to get higher every day,<br/>
A clear dawn,<br/>
Will be lit above the Motherland.<br/><br/>
 
Glory to those who look forward!<br/>
Glory to those who go forward!<br/>
Our path starts from the present<br/>
To the bright future!<br/>
Our path starts from the present<br/>
To the coming years!<br/><br/>
 
The path of heroes is a difficult one...<br/>
I trust that weâ€™ll walk together,<br/>
Over an unsteady forest path,<br/>
Over a ringing moon path.<br/><br/>
 
Glory to those who look forward!<br/>
Glory to those who go forward!<br/>
Our path starts from the present<br/>
To the bright future!<br/>
Our path starts from the present<br/>
To the coming years!<br/><br/>
 
To our Motherland we give,<br/>
The brightness of tomorrow,<br/>
Everyone will be like Gagarin,<br/>
Everyone will be like Titov.<br/><br/>
 
Glory to those who look forward!<br/>
Glory to those who go forward!<br/>
Our path starts from the present<br/>
To the bright future!<br/>
Our path starts from the present<br/>
To the coming years!<br/>

			<h2>My address is the Soviet Union</h2>
			<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RaR--qgL0XQ&pp=ygUrbXkgYWRkcmVzcyBpcyB0aGUgc292aWV0IHVuaW9uIGluc3RydW1lbnRhbA%3D%3D">link to YouTube</a></p>

				This is a Soviet popular song that sounds much better than the songs of that random American singer whose name is the same as Taylor Polynomials. The song motivates people to be hardworking (unlike certain students) and prioritise important things. Also, my address is literally the Soviet Union. (infinityintegral.su) Lyrics are below.
			</p>
			<p>
The wheels of railway carriages,<br/>
Dictate us where we should meet at once,<br/>
My telephone numbers,<br/>
Are scattered around different cities.<br/><br/>
 
The heart cares, the heart is being worried,<br/>
The postal cargo is being packed.<br/><br/>
 
My address is not a (number of a) house, not a (name of a) street,<br/>
My address is the Soviet Union!<br/><br/>
 
Telegraph dots and dashes,<br/>
(You should) look for me on building sites,<br/>
Today it's not the personal matters that are important,<br/>
But a summary of a working day.<br/><br/>
 
The heart cares, the heart is being worried,<br/>
The postal cargo is being packed.<br/><br/>
 
My address is not a (number of a) house, not a (name of a) street,<br/>
My address is the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>
 
I'm there where the able (knowledgeable) guys are,<br/>
I'm where there are posters "Go ahead!"<br/>
Where the working country is singing<br/>
Its new songs for its working people.<br/><br/>
 
The heart cares, the heart is being worried,<br/>
The postal cargo is being packed.<br/><br/>
 
My address is not a (number of a) house, not a (name of a) street,<br/>
My address is the Soviet Union.<br/>
