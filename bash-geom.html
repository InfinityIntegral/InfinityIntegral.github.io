			<h1>The Analytic method</h1>
			<p>
				Bashing in Geometry (or using the Analytic method) refer to using Algebra to represent structures in Geometry and then using algebraic manipulation to solve the question. This has the advantage of not requiring any “magic observations” but takes longer to solve. You can just find the locations of every point to see if what you need is true. In proofing contests where time is not a priority, this is a great option.
			</p>
			<p>
				To use bashing methods, you need to know the structure of your system and what problems it can be best used for. There exist many systems available, from the easiest length bashing to the extremely complicated Barycentric Coordinates. Most of these systems are included in part 2 of <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/geombook.html">EGMO</a>, with the exception of angle chase which some people do not consider to be bash.
			</p>
			<h2>Angle chase</h2>
			<p>
				Some people do not consider this to be bash as this is often a required step in Synthetic solutions. By angle chase, I refer to finding all the angles and taking the one you want, instead of finding only specific angles that you need (because you do not know which ones you need). Since this method mainly deals with angles, problems with many conditions about angles is suitable. Even though you find all the angles, you only write down necessary ones in your answer to pretend you solved the question Synthetically.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this method is not affected by angle bisectors which cause trouble in many other systems. Therefore, you can try using this if there are angle bisectors, since those produce equal pairs of angles that are beneficial to angle chase. Cyclic quadrilaterals (possibly hidden) is also suitable for this as cyclic quadrilaterals give many equal angles. Lastly, if there are many parallel lines, angle chase can be simplified a lot.
			</p>
			<p>
				You should definitely not expect angle chase to solve the full problem (unless you are doing a easy contest) as the problem setters are all aware that this exist and thus will prevent you from using this. Usually, angle chase can be used together with other methods to solve a problem or be used to prove a simple lemma.
			</p>
			<h2>Length + Trig</h2>
			<p>
				Using some trigonometrical rules such as the sine and cosine rules, angle conditions can be converted to lengths. This allows us to angle chase through length, or length chase through angles.
			</p>
			<p>
				This method is also relatively simple and does not have a coordinate system, so using it on simple problems is a good idea. Trigonometrical expressions are long and annoying to write, so you would not want too many of them together. Using trig also causes terms containing fractions (half angle formulas, double angle tangent), high power terms (double angle formulas) and radicals (cosine rule), so you should not use trig for overly complicated problems if not you will have all these in your workings.
			</p>
			<p>
				If all angles in a problem are multiples of 30, it is probably a good idea to use trig. Trigonometrical expressions for multiples of 30 are (relatively) exceptionally nice, and so can be computed directly. If you forget one of these, simply split a equilateral triangle in half. Most other trigonometrical expressions cannot be directly computed by hand, and so they must cancel out if you are successful in using trig. If you find that those expressions do not cancel out, just use another method.
			</p>
			<p>
				This method is often used in short answer contests as a step in a synthetic solution. Quite a lot of the Geometry official solutions in SMO Open Round 1 contain trigonometrical steps, so this may be a required part of the problem. Appearances of trigonometry is also common in the AMC 10, AMC 12 and AIME.
			</p>
			<h2>Cartesian Coordinates</h2>
			<p>
				This is the most well known method of bashing and is even inside the curriculum. However, as opposed to the curriculum, you do not find exact coordinates of points, but instead find algebraic expressions for these coordinates. Equating these coordinates using conditions in the problem should provide some useful results.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since you need a right angle to intersect your x and y axis, problems with a central right angle are very suitable. Cartesian Coordinates can handle perpendicularity very well as this can be expressed using gradients of lines. Dividing a segment into 2 with fixed proportiontions is qlso convenient due to Intercept Theorem. Intercept Theorem allows easy calculation of coordinates, so having many parallel lines is a good idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cartesian Coordinates is one system that is not suited for angle bisectors. It can handle 1 angle bisector or a pair of perpendicular angle bisectors by setting them as the axis, but no more than that. If there is a random angle bisector, the Angle Bisector Theorem would be required, which is very annoying. Circles also are not good for Cartesian Coordinates. Setting one as the unit circle can be fine if you are willing to use coordinates containing trigonometrical expressions, but anything else forms radicals which is hard to calculate. Cartesian Coordinates often involve polynomial fractions that you do not want to square both sides of.
			</p>
			<h2>Complex Numbers Coordinates</h2>
			<p>
				This is simply using a single complex number as the coordinate of a point since they cover the whole plane. You do not use the a + bi form as that is Cartesian Coordinates and definitely not the re^iθ form as that will not help in any way. Instead, you forget that real numbers exist and use single variables to represent complex numbers, usually the name of the points. To test for real points or inaginary points, you use the conjugate which work well with the unit circle.
			</p>
			<p>
				A typical start of a proof using complex numbers should appear like “let the circumcircle of triangke ABC be the unit circle. We let A = a, B = b, C = c.” The whole system revolves around the unit circle, which is usually the circumcircle of the main triangle. Using the unit circle extensively simplifys formulas needed and allow for computation in a reasonable amount of time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since we need a unit circle to set, problems with a circumcircle is suitable. The more significant points you can get onto the unit circle, the simpler your coordinate system will be. Reflecting points, partitioning a segment into 2 parts, and finding centroids and orthocentres of triangles on the unit circle have nice formulas. In particular, reflecting the orthocentre of the main triangle is very convenient.
			</p>
			<p>
				The formula for circumcentre is complicated, which is why we set the origin to be a circumcentre to simplify computation. Having angle bisectors or additional circles is also not a nice idea. Very strangely, the complex coordinate system has no “equation of a line” and has a extremely complicated intersection formula. Therefore, you should avoid attempting problems with too many lines with complex.
			</p>
			<p>
				To make this even more powerful, we can simultaneously use multiple Complex Numbers Coordinates systems and Cartesian Coordinate systems, with change of basis functions to move between systems. This allows us to take advantage of multiple features of the questions that is nice for our coordinate systems, and bypass difficult computation.
			</p>
			<h2>Barycentric Coordinates</h2>
			<p>
				This is the coordinate system you get when you force 3 unit vectors into a 2D plane somehow, pretend they are linearly independent, and have no origin. Despite being extremely weird, this system is very powerful and can solve any Geometry problem. Although this is much better when faced with difficult problems, it overcomplicates simple problems. Many Barycentric formulas are long and complicated, causing usage of the system to be very time consuming. You should definitely not use this for short answer contests as you will run out of time. For proofing, you can use it for aesthetic purposes if you have time.
			</p>
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<p>
				And that will be the end of our summary about bashing Geometry. If you are stuck on a Geometry problem next time, remember that synthetic is <span style="text-decoration:line-through">stupid and you should never use it</span> not your only option.
