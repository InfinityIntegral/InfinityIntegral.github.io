hi, user.

this is my personal website. however I dont really have anything yet, so it is inactive

currently I only have 1 page on my website, which is a page to display the school timetable. anywhere else you go, you will see the error 404 page that threatens to call your parents (no, we wont actually call them... probably).

my website pages tend to be extremely simple and the code is not even structured properly. this is because GitHub Pages free plan has a usage limit that depends on the size of the HTML files, so I am trying to minimise the file size.
