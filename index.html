			<h2>About this website</h2>
			<p>
				This is not a blog or a forum. This website contains most of what you need to become good at Math Olympiad without any form of tuition. I strongly support self studying as methods created by others may not be as easy to understand as your own methods (thus I made / combined all the weird coordinate systems instead of actually following EGMO) There are also links to other websites where you can learn Math Olympiad, Informatics Olympiads, and coding.
			</p>
			<p>
				This website is made using GitHub Pages, a free website development tool. It is entirely custom made using HTML, and anyone can do something similar with a GitHub free account (see all the videos on Youtube about this). As you can clearly see, this website is better than my old one, which has random advertisements about my website that I dont want and cannot disable. Also, I tested that my website can now be accessed in China and Russia, unlike the previous one.
			</p>
			<p>
				My website style is consistent with all my other accounts. The colour choice is always neon red #FF00C8 (which is just pink) and neon blue #00C8FF. (Note that neon refers to the highlighter colour, not the 10th element). All characters in the link are in English (so if some website use a different style or has a cyrillic character a in the link, it is probably not this).
			</p>
			<p>
				You should only use links (shown in neon yellow #FFFF00) to navigate the site. There may be private pages on the website, so you can only enter a page if it can be reached by following a series of links starting from the home page, or permission has been granted by me. If you know that a page can be accessed, you can directly enter the URL. There are links to certain pages present in the navigation bar at the right of every page. According to ChatGPT, unauthorised access to a private page can potentially violate Article 272 of the Russian Criminal Code and Article 285 of the Chinese Criminal Code, so do not do it.

				If you find a mistake / typo / logical fault / fake proof / very inaccurate diagram in any of my posts, pls immediately message me on Instagram as I do not want to accidentally mislead anyone.

			<h2>How you can help</h2>
			<p>
				Math Olympiad papers from the DPR Korea &#127472;&#127477; is very incomplete on the Internet. (I searched AoPS, Google, Russian School of Math, Baidu, Yandex and cannot find anything) If somehow you find a collection of these questions, pls immediately send them to me on Instagram so that I can post them on AoPS to help others looking for them.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am looking for any Math Olympiad questions (not Math curriculum questions) from the DPR Korea, including both MCQ / short-answer questions and proofing questions with difficulty ranging from AMC 8 to China TST. I already have the questions listed below.
