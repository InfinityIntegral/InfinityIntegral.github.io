			<h1>Art of Problem Skipping</h1>
			<p>
				In the SMO Round 1, you have only 2h 30min (Junior and Senior) or 3h (Open) to solve 25 very difficult questions. Even the best students will face a shortage of time in this situation. To make it worse, some questions are construction type, or require a single idea that is difficult to see, instead of a easy to see process leading you to the answer. To deal with time shortage, we can skip time consuming questions and possibly come back to them later.
			</p>
			<h2>Difficult questions</h2>
			<p>
				Obviously, we need to skip overly difficult questions to first get the easy ones. Thus, it should be quite clear that if you cannot think of any possible approach after a long time, you should probably skip the question. However, I do not recommend giving up immediately after seeing a question that appears to be difficult. It is possible that the question is a “scam” that looks difficult but is actually easy. You can consider spending 5 min on that question just to make sure that you do not lose a mark for no reason. This keeps you within the time limit since spending 5 min per question gives a total time spent of 125 min, so you still have 25 min to do tedious calculations.
			</p>
			<p>
				A category of this kind of questions is Geometry. If you are unable to <a href="./accurate-drawing">measure out the answer</a> or use <a href="./bash-geom">Analytic methods</a>, it is probably a good idea to skip. Usually, Geometry questions involve unexpected observations, which can be very hard to find unless you are experienced at Geometry.
			</p>
			<h2>Tedious computation</h2>
			<p>
				Another type of questions that you may want to skip is those containing tedious computation. This is often in the form of casework, or operating with large numbers multiple times. These computations can be very time consuming and thus you can leave them to the end to avoid wasting marks from problems with shorter solutions. It is also possible that the problem is not tedious, but you found an alternate solution that so happens to be. In this case, you should attempt to simplify your solution and categorise cases to reduce computation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this does not include questions involving a single tedious calculation. Almost every year, the SMO Open Round 1 will contain a question whose answer is the sum of a polynomial expression from 1 to some number n. In this case, you can find the answer in a reasonable amount of time and the idea of the question tend to be quite simple. You should never waste your marks by skipping these questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				When skipping a question with tedious calculations, you already have the idea but it is too time consuming to be safely computed. Therefore, you have a much higher chance of solving such questions than difficult questions which you do not have the idea of. You can mark out these types of skipped questions differently and return to the ones which you are more likely to solve first.
			</p>
			<h2>Returning to skipped questions</h2>
			<p>
				If you have time after attempting all questions that are not skipped, you can choose to return to skipped questions. To maximise the number of questions you solve, you should attempt those in order of increasing difficulty. If you are still unable to solve the questions, just skip them again and repeat until time runs out or you have solved all the questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before re attempting skipped questions, you must make sure that you will definitely receive whatever marks that you already have. This means that you have to first check your answers and shade in your answer sheet.
			</p>
			<p>
				When deciding to skip questions, you should not erase any workings related to them. These workings can be very convenient if you have time to return to that question. You should also organise your workings well on your paper (instead of squeezing them on the margins of the question paper) so that you do not need to waste time looking for something that you have written down.

				Something else written in a margin:<br/><div style="font-size:20px">Cubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadratoquadratum in duos quadratoquadratos & generaliter nullam in infinitum ultra quadratum potestatem in duos eiusdem nominis fas est dividere cuius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet. <br/><br/>(Now it is right to divide a cube into two cubes, or a square into two squares, and in general there is no power to infinity beyond the square that can be divided into two of the same, of which I have indeed discovered a wonderful demonstration, that the smallness of the margin would not take.)</div><br/><div style="text-align:right;font-size:20px">-- Fermat</div>
